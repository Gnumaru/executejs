/*
 * ********** execute.js **********
 * 
 * The purpose of this library is to implement a minimalistic
 * "include/import/using" functionality in javascript, to prevent using several
 * script tags into a html file. This is NOT suposed to be an asynchronous
 * module loader like requirejs, or a synchronous module dependency resolver and
 * build tool like browserify, it is intended to do at runtime exactly what a
 * php interpreter would do when encountering the require and require_once
 * function calls, or what a C compiler preprocessor would do with a include
 * statement
 * 
 * There is not yet a greatly accepted standard for javascript code modularity
 * handling (I'm not talking about code modules definitions and usage, that is
 * covered by Comonjs and AMD, but code modularity, the way by which code is
 * separated into several files and run, be it preprocessed and bundled into a
 * single file or not). Some people use several build tools like browserify or
 * other tools to parse dependencies and preproces/concatenate files
 * accordingly. Others use libraries like require.js to load different module
 * files at runtime, and others separate their code into several script files
 * and add several <include> tags in the page header.
 * 
 * execute.js is intended to be a minimalistc tool to execute a given in-domain
 * script that contains dependencies for the script which is calling it, or that
 * contais procedures to be executed. Say you have a "Person" class (javascript
 * constructor function) defined into "http://(websiteurl)/js/model/Person.js"
 * and you want to use this class into several other files. Just execute once
 * the file, execute("model/Person.js"), and the class will be defined by the
 * application lifetime. Or say you have a procedure that is schedulled (by
 * whathever means) to be executed continuously every minute. you could just put
 * a require("myAwesomeProcedure.js"); inside your scheduler and that's all
 * 
 * execute.js does not address the scopping (handling conflicts because of using
 * global variables) problem AT ALL because that is something you already would
 * be addressing by yourself when using several <script> tags
